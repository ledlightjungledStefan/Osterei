Hallo? "A creators dilema".

What was my first intention to handle my steps,
to observe what is present.

It is not possible to copy the mouse pointer. But I can
use the paint program and choce in the tool section

the povečevalno steklo.
[sanje in njihov pomen](https://dromen.site/sl/povecevalno-steklo/)

[najdi.si](http://www.najdi.si/najdi/pove%c4%8devalno%20steklo)
The two possible relations to the word najdi in this case are

najdi find or najdi si find for yourself.
Although languages in internet are integer islands in real

world naj is should and the french word for say is dit.
Some recreations in windows are in the settings section.

If you want of a device with two buttons the main button
the one without a context menu you can set the setting.

But beware. It responds immediatly. With chocen main button
press as oft as possible on the button in the paint program

an draw a mouse pointer. When done look for a spot that changes
the pointer to a ... (how do i look for).

I try mouse pointer in a search engine. I found with the SEO
automation

With the site

[Open Cursor Library](http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-library)
i found this

and with a click on it

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75255909/194127279-66b31e45-2c8d-4a46-89eb-0369d6b0cf41.png)
I asume for me textcursor is the proper textword for it in this case.

With the link on line 36 of this blog i can reach my
html site index.

I can set the pointer rigth of the textword breaks. When ipush the
pointer to left on the breaks the pointer changes.

I can double click on it or asume why snake pliscot and double dragon
are related in my case.

With the trained possiblity to select a datatype i can go with my eyes
one step below to the datatype public.

With the chance that i can recognize something
not someone else because i am alone and not

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75255909/194129010-e2ea869d-e89d-45a1-bcb8-3c95a25e778f.png)
So it is possible that with a double click i can select

to the mentioned branch public.
"Theater: Mister branch. Yes sir mister stop and go pasttense yes sir."

What is a proof? Maybe a pro of, what?
The textcursor on the rigth in the markdown editor is

below the site with the titel HelpAccess.
With the next change to the site and a double click

below the breaks in the datatype branch public the selected
field will have two colours. Before that it will have had

two colours. Molestyle because if i printscreen the chars
and look them up in the paint program they have more

than one colour.
I speak slovene alot of german very rare english and some

words french. With the selected "word" i asume that also ruby i can
look the contribution tutorial in a W3 site

is not for languages that always tend "to speak".
"Theater: Slam the unspeakable language web that speaks always blabla".

With the shift key pressed until it is released and a push
and pull figth for the end button i would have selected

the whole line. With the release of a shift key i can now count to seventeen
and try again in addition to the previous

event now i can past the end button press and release the downkey
button.
