Hallo? "A creators dilema".
'MessageBox.Show("")

I am not happy about the internet. Some words i do not translate
like "einschüchtern".

The xbox game L.A. Noir is also about interogations. 18+.
Th people whome i do not know know that they cant point

out the main questions. In the "game" you can start as street
security. I used the buttons until a scene that was for me

easy enough to leave. The first interogation between a juwel
thief character and me as ...

it was a loop. When i do not get the "solution" the game loops
in the interogation scene.

Some devices that manipulate barin waves cant be 2caugth".
So whats left. Wish.

It is not the only xbox disc that does not alter the storage units
on disk.

Long ago lets say aproximatly three to five years ago
a choce a youtube video

about someone in northern america.
In the end the information was he studied a stone structure.

The informations were saved to a disk. The big once not 3'5
. A programming language was used and the layout was

written for the information on the disk.
The disk has to be used with a floopy drive and they who

ever they are bougth one on ebay. The funny part was
that the information with the progarmming language was

written for a specific diskdrive speed. So they opened
the disk drive and adjusted the speed.

The main point for me is that also technology evolved.
There are so many different PC architectures

that also the programmin languages are a part of the
hardware.

Old transistors are like bulbs the wolfram wire burns
until its burned.

Moods and tensiosn are also apart of my live to change
something does not mean its less or more imporant

than finding something with operating system.
The planet is a slave to tehcnolgies related

with electricity. Instead i work with windows if possible
to solve the riddle electricty.

I do not know but it is asumable for me that embded systems
like with the programm civilization

or simcity are calculating with "Rechnungen" and are older
than me.

Speed is the most foolish stuff on this planet.
With windows sntences like "on line by line basis"

point out the importance to use electricity in a proper way.
And the moer systems are in internet the faster it gets.

Unprepared.
The "Trichter" something like a cone, is mots of the time
filled with colours and polygons.

The second level to "build" structures that are similar to
electronic circuits and devices

is also a loop that is not easy to eascape.
The most foolish stuff speed is obvious a lack

to explain how to work with security issues and
noooen can escape.

To leave a buildng means to build a sceond mainfraim.
Inside tutorals have the measurment.

No escape.
