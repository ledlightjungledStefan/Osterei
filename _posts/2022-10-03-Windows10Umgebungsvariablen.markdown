Hallo mein Name ist Stefan. Ich lerne Programmieren.
PCs bauen ist schwer erklären dagegn sehr.

In the movie the 5 Elemnt the object a scpaeship had
some sort of something that was removed befor a start

sequenz was launched. I strongly recomend me for myself
it has not been a take off.

If you would ask someone related to me how to build a
hardware device you would get as answer nothing. Silence.

The something was silnce. If you maybe try to interogate the
silented from my point of view something you could not live

with the answer to build a PC.
The amount of a potato or citron battery electriciity used to

build a striagth line depneds. You ask maybe yourself on what?
Depends.

Where is the difference if there is one?
What tools do i have to find a solution for my question?

First if i would know the capacitor operator positions with our without a timer
(wolf cry rather high) i would have typed to solve my question.

Second, events.
I have a button with a dimensionname 'define'.

Used with this or that.
NA. Still i can use a click event with the other button.

It is not possible to get rid of

under any circumstances this is not possible

The worlds or at least my worlds solution grid without solved
properties is that even if change of matter occures

while elektrons with the proper proton and neutron keys
are moved or are moving a phse for buildnig words or sentences

is not changing storage units connected to logic circuits.
The aimed change is not predefined.

A button on a form can be triggered with the enter key.

For me it is like storage units are not changed, hm complicated, yes
