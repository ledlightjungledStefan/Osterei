I do not know to whom writte the next story.

I have told it some people.
Once i was alone at home someone called me and

said not at the start
"I am from the firma microsoft"

some peolpe realy do not know how to care for others.
The story was a little bit like this.

He offered me to ged rid of some extra lines
of äh error entries in a settings case of

windows. I am polite and foloowed the conversation
to see if i can learn something about windows.

With run program if can find it in the windows
system explorer i can attache it to the taskbar

you can start with the entry eventvwr
a window called "Ereignisanzeige" in german language.

I have about 10.949 Events registered not from me
automatic.

Miscellanious some warnings errors ect.
I asume a kin of hide and seek game in a web.

The seller? said "you have errors on your PC"
"tell me how many" I said i dont know

10.000 and the answer was not i or we will help
you but "your system damages the internet"

something like that. It is possible to talk
serious even if the case is droping below foolishnes.

I do not know everthing about windows but what i
know is that i am aware what is automatic and not

a prt of my obveserved possiblities is hold to loos
and let go.

Therefore every password saved automatic is more stress
than comfort.

So i heard that there is a teamprogram for äh remote control.
I thougth ok but in windows one is integrated.

So i said "yes in windows is one integrated"
and heard "no you have to install one"

to tell in my broken english the next steps

lets say he was exhausted because i did not foloowed
and told further information?

Why not he would have get it but Ja the rigth steps you know. Hm.
So at the end of the call he tried

to sell me his H chm elp.
And said something like

"you can pay with steamcards"
Sonetimes foolishnes realy hurts.

No thanks. Next time he called the conversation was like
that he said my college will explain to you

and i said yes ok
past some words the "college" said you are a fool to me.

That was the point i took the initiativ and was
whith my choice that i said back "nono YOU are no fool"

HM: hm.
That made him over all very angry.

They just called once again and i was again
polite as usuall and he immidatly hung up.

That is why i know some people not personal that
reroot and do not only not understand.
