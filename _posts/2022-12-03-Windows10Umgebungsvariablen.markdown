assumption: supposed i would have a test about readability
conclusion: the second dimension is possible without the the third

assumption: the propertyname is a member of a property in an other file
conclusion: controls can have members

assumption: readability has an aim
conclusion: the amount of an synonym is not an attribute

assumption: electricity is pure logic
conclusion: shortcuts are swirls

beings who maintain "farbverwaltung" cannot post datamembers everywhere
abstract post datamemebers somewhere

assumption: while enrgy flows within nature it is not only part of the nature at all
