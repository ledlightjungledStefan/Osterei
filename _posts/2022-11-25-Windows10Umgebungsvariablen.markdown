Since different properties (with what)
example a background color

if the first line in the text document
has entry

for example BackColor=Green
i can open the notpad with the entry and delete Backcolor=

deleting a process takes time
the storage units are changed to default and the energy configuration

is not changed meanwhile
to confirm for myself what i do i can also delete the propertyname textfield

in the databindings add roundbrackets
because i can change it to a textfield "Backcolor"

If i would make a new entry and it would not be an object
with the keyword new

still the storage units for text characters are not effected
or the energy in storage units for capacitors ecetera

the next step my step i take is the less obvious part
the array or list of name "stringtheorie"

i have two probably entries
one in the propertyname field

and the other in the datasource field
with the split keyword i have two new arrays

therefore it could be used one and zero
so the user who posted an answer was rigth to suppose that i have no

idea of my mainframe architecture with the connected screen
and it is still wise to use textenvironmentelements

my paint screen has a size 1269 x 808px
how do i prove that i cannot prove it

neither can i prove how to be understud
because even if i start with a not narrated color (splash)

what nodes do i use for me with the keyword DATAMEMBER
first i am glad that the youtube channel offered me to work

with moveable tables in java scripting
and second the possibility i have not constructed until now

observe implementations when a scripting is visibel
some sort of animations happen

if change the tables to be not selectable after dragging
i cannot put them back where they have been

like a magnet that is where it was not pinable again and obsole
second it could be used to caste votes

in case a person would chose something with a porbably use of a \<s\> tag
or to put the table somwhere else

not on the same spot where an additional animated square will never fade in
memory

the datatable theorie for me has the aim to use indexes
selectable

although an index with shapes is spotable it is not necessary with arrays
field equasions with squares and other shapes

tend to be fougth with textenvironments
it took me time to find the word again it was the paradigma shifting

in programming languages
why should textequasions solve a problem the leidener flask was not only

shaped with guttenberg books
or was it?

What do is search? The Displaymember, well it is possible.
The easy way to go on, no it's not the easy way to go on.

Theater in progress.
The characters have nodes. Until ... hm.

The color, a color is not a shape. Joker, sentences like
if the color has not a shape the documentations about dispatcher

also have no shapes.
Time?
