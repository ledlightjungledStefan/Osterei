With the link below i post some additional text from the linked content
and my own thougths

[Datasource, Datamember, Displaymemeber, Valuemember](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/348451bd-f0c8-461e-b62d-eb81dd606318/datasource-datamember-displaymemeber-valuemember?forum=winformsdatacontrols)

Here's some "quick" advice:
Here is not There and T is not an island i am not here or there

and a center is not left that i need a quick advice and suppose that quotation mark
does not lead to a quick answer

but an answer is not an advice and so an advice can be fast or slow
pedning on how much i know about a text written or typed

my conclusion would be i do not know was it written or typed or otherwise compiled
this asumptoins have been typed within choices

the jekyll markdown date in the filename is probably dipslayed also somewhere
else accurate

the mentioned article was posted probably march 2008
why is this importand for me

because what was typed in the article is not enough to solve the problem
let me show you what i got so far

and for the song that has been written to prevent cases
it does matter because i suppose that a delivery system that changes post codes

can be closed after usage but is it everywhere so, No.

using the keyword controls is protected by the usage of a tagline
the tagline \<s\> is used to pull a line through atext

the first problem with language without computers is frequencies are in 2 dimensions
and that is not a problem at all

it is not easy to formualte a conclusion
while a proteryname is not a error it is a member of a control

while a member is not used properly within a control it cannot be a propertyname
maybe

the english language is not explained with the word bindingsource and also
the word electricity is not electricity with and also with the word bindingsource

my main spot is that shapes and text are like boxing to letrarly free the mind for blanance
some automations are set obsolet and not also revoced

like html let
i asume for me because i know i also can be crazy

if i would have been ultron and took thors hammer it would have been the same as if i would
be able to start from scratch having a span color password

and the colorfrenquencies with my vga screen would relate to my enviromnet to chose a first
color and i could grant with my keyboard that a final char

is available to make a first datamebernod
help with confirmation possibilities would have been eminent

so i stoped aim toribash blender and spriter pro
or change documentations

never the less since i do not understand how to build a listbox control bindingsource form project
with visual basic within netframework

i cannot avoid beeing recles
recles about haveing a lisbox with displaymember for a textfile

for only two rectangles
"When configuring a Bindingsource Set DataSource to a DataSet and Set DataMmeber to a DataTable"

From Ant Misbehavin' a quest in fallout new vegas the next picture copy pasted from a bing picture search
not uploaded from me

"When configuring a Control Set DataSource to a BindingSource Leave DataMember blank"

It is not cas that i do not know how to configure a control (and case is a fall and not time like ƒças in slovene language)
instead my configuraiton is to aim a label control

search for the propertyname to type the member in the control with the

propertyname
still i am not happy that "Eigentum" a legions ear to get "eigenschaft"

are one and the same member and if possible of a class
i asume for me that a displaymember is a part of a datatable and therefore a datamember

What is a dataset?
The content of a textfile.

With a property get for a displaymemberoutput in a listbox in the listcontrol.displaymember
documentations the set keyword is not entered. Ok.

Now the headache: storage units are i get or set.
get without runtime. why not?
