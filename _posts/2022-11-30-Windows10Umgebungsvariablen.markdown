Here's some "quick" advice:
Here is not There and T is not an island i am not here or there

and a center is not left that i need a quick advice and suppose that quotation mark
does not lead to a quick answer

pedning on how much i know about a text written or typed

my conclusion would be i do not know was it written or typed or otherwise compiled
