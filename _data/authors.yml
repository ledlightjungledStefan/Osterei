//Authors
//To add a new author to the site, you must do three things:
//
//1. Add an entry to the /_data/authors.yml file with the appropriate fields filled in.
//2. Duplicate one of the markdown.md files in the /_authors folder and use the name: _
//   value that you added to the /_data/authors.yml file in step 1 above.
//3. Use the author’s name: value as a string in the authors: ['your_new_author_name'] yaml entries in guides or samples.
//
//   That’s it. NOTE: If you are building the site locally, results may be cached so a new author might not show up in the list. _
//   You can force a full rebuild of the site by deleting the /_site folder.
